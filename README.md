# Cognitive-Science-Examples

Collection of cog sci koans for different computational approaches in a variety of languages.

## So far...

- [LÃ©vy flights](https://github.com/mt-digital/Cognitive-Science-Examples/blob/master/L%C3%A9vy%20Flights.ipynb)


## To possibly include...

- Pink noise and cognitive performance
- Iterated learning model for the evolution of language
- Opinion dynamics - biased assimilation and bounded confidence
- Word vectors and detecting 
- Latent Dirichlet Allocation and semantic networks
- Detrended frequency analysis and the Fourier transform (could connect to pink
  noise and cognitive performance)
